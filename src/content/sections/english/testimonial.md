Service included organising professional guide, chef, transport, food and renting all necessary gear including personal stuff like puffy or proper gloves.Overall experience was very satisfying so I can recommend Andean Kingdom for mountaineering."

    content: "We went to Andean Kingdom to inquire about some adventurous activities in Huaraz. We ended up renting kit for climbing outdoors and undertaking the Santa Cruz trek. We also completed a guided expedition of Ulta Chico on Luly‚Äôs recommendation which was the highlight of our travels. She was so helpful advising us about our Santa Cruz trek which we did independently. The kit was of a really high standard, great quality and very reasonably priced for hire. All the staff were so friendly and welcoming and we had such a great time in Huaraz on their recommendations and support. Thank you so much Luly! Would absolutely recommend."

    content: "Andean Kingdom are a fantastic group, with friendly service and well priced gear. We hired a tent, sleeping bags, mats, cooking equipment and poles for 8 days of the Huayhuash trek (which was incredible!!), and the rental experience was perfect. Good value, gear was quality (necessary given the conditions you can face in the Andes), and we would definitely use them again! Thank you Luly and team ‚ù§Ô∏èüèïÔ∏è"

    content: "This place is amazing. Luly sat with us for the better part of an hour offering advice for doing the huayhuash trek on our own. The people are so so nice, and a wealth of knowledge for all activities in the area. They are also fully stocked with rental equipment, maps, guidebooks, and anything you may need to get out climbing or hiking. If you are looking at getting out to the mountains in huaraz, this is the place to start."
